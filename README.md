##Dev-Mini Project log

**Introduction**
For the Dev Mini project, I wanted to implement everything that I had learnt in the previous tasks, use Github and go through a similar process that August would when create a new website.
As for the idea for the project, Isabel (my mentor) suggested I chose a fun topic, so I came up with the idea to create a quiz for my university friends based on a discussion I had with them about what kind of pants they wear. 

**Copy and Design**
Before I started coding I first had to work out what the website would look like and what it would say. 
So I did some research, looked at quiz websites I wanted to take inspiration from. Then I sketched up a few concepts on paper. 
After Isabel had checked it over, I then went into designing with Figma. Figma was also very new to me, however with Bridget's help I was able to complete my prototype. 
Then I wrote all of the copy in a GoogleDocument which I got one of my university friends to check over.
I wanted to test if the questions made any sense, so I tried quizzing my parents and brother to see if the questions were easy to understand. 

**Build**
It was then time to build. I started with the homepage, index.html and worked from there. I incorporated a lot of my previous knowledge, however I also had to used online resources to find out how to achieve _exactly_ what I wanted. Isabel helped me on the way, but she made sure that I had a decent go at fixing the problem before she guided me to a possible solution. 
At the moment of writing this README file, phase one of the project has almost been completed and is just having a few fixes and edits here and there.

**The future and phase two.**
After I finish tweeking up the website, I will send it to my university friends for them to play around with it- sort of like user testing.
Then Isabel and I will move onto phase two and incorporate PHP and SASS to enhance it even further.
