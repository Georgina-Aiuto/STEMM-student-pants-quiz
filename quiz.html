            <p class="mainBody">Sure you are interested and you see how STEMM can aid a lot of your future creative dreams, but at the end of the day if there was an easy way to do the same via something more expressive than you would have done so instead. This may hinder your dedication to your future career, and no matter what job you will achieve you will never be able to fully fulfil your need for innovation and fixing every problem you see in the most flashy way possible.
