                <label>Fine arts, music, or anything creative.</label>

                <input type="radio" value="j1">
                <label>It is okay. I’d rather not, but I understand why I need it for my other subjects to make sense.</label>

                <input type="radio" value="c1">
                <label>I find it difficult, but the challenge is great!</label>

                <input type="radio" value="t1">
                <label>Do not care, as long as I pass. I will study maths at the very minimum requirement.</label>

                <label>The explosions are pretty cool. Or the icky gross biology bits. Or the strange nature of both is and isn’t in quantum physics. I just want to study all the weird wacky and wonderful parts of STEMM.</label>

                <input type="radio" value="t1">
